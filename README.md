# Retail Sales Analytics & Forecasting (Rossmann)

This project explores daily sales data from Rossmann retail stores and builds a forecasting model to predict future sales.  
The goal was to simulate a real business problem: understanding what factors drive sales (promotions, competition, seasonality, store type) and creating a reliable predictive model that can help retailers plan better.

## ðŸ”Ž What I Did
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends, seasonality, and promo/holiday effects.
- Engineered features such as **lags, rolling averages, competition months open, and calendar features**.
- Built and compared models, with **XGBoost** emerging as the best performer.
- Evaluated performance using **RMSE, MAPE, and RÂ²** on a hold-out period.

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Outcomes
- Achieved a forecasting accuracy of **YY% (MAPE)** with XGBoost.  
- Identified **promo campaigns, lag features, and competition distance** as the strongest sales drivers.  
- Produced recruiter-friendly visuals like **feature importance** and **actual vs predicted sales** charts.
